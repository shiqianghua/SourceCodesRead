A name is a sequence of path elements separated by a slash (/). Every node in ZooKeeper's namespace is identified by a path
名称是由斜杠(/)分隔的路径元素序列。ZooKeeper名称空间中的每个节点都由一个路径标识

ZooKeeper also has the notion of ephemeral nodes. These znodes exists as long as the session that created the znode is active. 
When the session ends the znode is deleted

•	Sequential Consistency - Updates from a client will be applied in the order that they were sent.
•	Atomicity - Updates either succeed or fail. No partial results.
•	Single System Image - A client will see the same view of the service regardless of the server that it connects to. i.e., a client will never see an older view of the system even if the client fails over to a different server with the same session.
•	Reliability - Once an update has been applied, it will persist from that time forward until a client overwrites the update.
•	Timeliness - The clients view of the system is guaranteed to be up-to-date within a certain time bound.
•顺序一致性——来自客户端的更新将按照发送的顺序进行。
原子性——更新成功或失败。没有部分结果。
•单个系统映像——无论连接到哪个服务器，客户机都将看到相同的服务视图。即。，即使客户机故障转移到具有相同会话的不同服务器，客户机也永远不会看到系统的旧视图。
•可靠性——一旦应用了更新，它将一直持续，直到客户端覆盖更新。
及时性-客户对系统的看法是保证在一定的时间范围内是最新的。

With the exception of the request processor, each of the servers that make up the ZooKeeper service replicates its own copy of each of the components.
除了请求处理器之外，构成ZooKeeper服务的每个服务器都复制每个组件的自己的副本。

As part of the agreement protocol all write requests from clients are forwarded to a single server, called the leader. The rest of the ZooKeeper servers, called followers, receive message proposals from the leader and agree upon message delivery. The messaging layer takes care of replacing leaders on failures and syncing followers with leaders
作为协议的一部分，所有来自客户端的写请求都被转发到一个名为leader的服务器上。Zookerper服务器的其余部分(称为追随者)接收来自领导者的消息建议，并就消息传递达成一致。消息层负责在出现故障时替换领导者，并将追随者与领导者同步
ZooKeeper uses a custom atomic messaging protocol. Since the messaging layer is atomic, ZooKeeper can guarantee that the local replicas never diverge. When the leader receives a write request, it calculates what the state of the system is when the write is to be applied and transforms this into a transaction that captures this new state
ZooKeeper使用自定义原子消息传递协议。因为消息层是原子的，所以ZooKeeper可以保证本地副本不会发散。当leader收到一个写请求时，它会计算将要应用的写时系统的状态，并将其转换为捕获这个新状态的事务

Benchmarks also indicate that it is reliable, too. Reliability in the Presence of Errors shows how a deployment responds to various failures. The events marked in the figure are the following:

Failure and recovery of a follower
Failure and recovery of a different follower
Failure of the leader
Failure and recovery of two followers
Failure of another leader
基准测试也表明它是可靠的。错误存在时的可靠性显示了部署如何响应各种故障。图中标注的事件如下:
跟随者的失败和恢复
失败和恢复的追随者不同
领导者的失败
两个追随者的失败和恢复
另一位领导者的失败

To show the behavior of the system over time as failures are injected we ran a ZooKeeper service made up of 7 machines
为了显示系统在注入故障时的随时间变化的行为，我们运行了一个由7台机器组成的ZooKeeper服务
There are a few important observations from this graph. First, if followers fail and recover quickly, 
then ZooKeeper is able to sustain a high throughput despite the failure. But maybe more importantly, 
the leader election algorithm allows for the system to recover fast enough to prevent throughput from dropping substantially.
In our observations, ZooKeeper takes less than 200ms to elect a new leader. Third, as followers recover, 
ZooKeeper is able to raise throughput again once they start processing requests

tickTime : the basic time unit in milliseconds used by ZooKeeper. It is used to do heartbeats and the minimum session timeout will be twice the tickTime
使用的以毫秒为单位的基本时间单位。它是用来做心跳和最小的会话超时将是滴答时间的两倍

For replicated mode, a minimum of three servers are required, and it is strongly recommended that you have an odd number of servers. 
If you only have two servers, then you are in a situation where if one of them fails, there are not enough machines to form a majority quorum. 
Two servers are inherently less stable than a single server, because there are two single points of failure.

initLimit和syncLimit区别：
The new entry, initLimit is timeouts ZooKeeper uses to limit the length of time the ZooKeeper servers in quorum have to connect to a leader. 
The entry syncLimit limits how far out of date a server can be from a leader.

With both of these timeouts, you specify the unit of time using tickTime. In this example, 
the timeout for initLimit is 5 ticks at 2000 milliseconds a tick, or 10 seconds.

The entries of the form server.X list the servers that make up the ZooKeeper service. When the server starts up, 
it knows which server it is by looking for the file myid in the data directory. That file has the contains the server number, 
in ASCII.
新的条目initLimit是ZooKeeper用来限制quorum里的ZooKeeper服务器必须连接到leader的超时时间。条目syncLimit限制了服务器与领导者之间的过时程度。
对于这两个超时，您可以使用tickTime指定时间单位。在本例中，initLimit的超时时间为5个节拍，每个节拍为2000毫秒，即10秒。
表单服务器的条目。列出构成ZooKeeper服务的服务器。当服务器启动时，它通过在数据目录中查找文件myid来知道它是哪个服务器。该文件包含服务器号，用ASCII表示。

Please be aware that setting up multiple servers on a single machine will not create any redundancy.
If something were to happen which caused the machine to die, all of the zookeeper servers would be offline. 
Full redundancy requires that each server have its own machine. It must be a completely separate physical server. 
Multiple virtual machines on the same physical host are still vulnerable to the complete failure of that host.
请注意，在一台机器上设置多个服务器不会产生任何冗余。如果发生了导致机器死亡的事情，所有的zookeeper服务器都将离线。完全冗余要求每个服务器都有自己的机器。
它必须是一个完全独立的物理服务器。同一物理主机上的多个虚拟机仍然容易受到该主机完全故障的影响。

Paths to nodes are always expressed as canonical, absolute, slash-separated paths; there are no relative reference.
Any unicode character can be used in a path subject to the following constraints
节点的路径总是表示为规范的、绝对的、斜杠分隔的路径;没有相对的参考。任何unicode字符都可以在受以下约束的路径中使用


note:
In distributed application engineering, the word node can refer to a generic host machine, a server, a member of an ensemble, a client process, etc.
In the ZooKeeper documentation, znodes refer to the data nodes. Servers refers to machines that make up the ZooKeeper service; 
quorum peers refer to the servers that make up an ensemble; client refers to any host or process which uses a ZooKeeper service
在分布式应用工程中，“节点”一词可以指一般的主机、服务器、集成的成员、客户端进程等。在ZooKeeper文档中，znodes指的是数据节点。
服务器指的是构成ZooKeeper服务的机器;quorum peer是指组成合集的服务器;
客户端是指任何使用ZooKeeper服务的主机或进程

Because of this behavior ephemeral znodes are not allowed to have children
When creating a znode you can also request that ZooKeeper append a monotonically increasing counter to the end of path. 
This counter is unique to the parent znode

The current implementation requires that the timeout be a minimum of 2 times the tickTime (as set in the server configuration)
and a maximum of 20 times the tickTime
当前实现要求超时最小为tickTime的2倍(在服务器配置中设置)，最大为tickTime的20倍

In particular we have heuristics built into the client library to handle things like "herd effect", etc... 
Only create a new session when you are notified of session expiration (mandatory)
特别是，我们在客户端库中构建了启发式机制来处理诸如“羊群效应”等问题。只有在会话过期通知时才创建新会话(强制)

Another parameter to the ZooKeeper session establishment call is the default watcher. 
Watchers are notified when any state change occurs in the client. For example if the client loses connectivity to the server the client will be notified, or if the client's session expires, etc... This watcher should consider the initial state to be disconnected (i.e. before any state changes events are sent to the watcher by the client lib).
In the case of a new connection, the first event sent to the watcher is typically the session connection event
ZooKeeper会话建立调用的另一个参数是默认的监视程序。当客户端发生任何状态变化时，观察者都会收到通知。
例如，如果客户端失去与服务器的连接，客户端将得到通知，或者如果客户端会话过期，等等。
此监视程序应该考虑断开初始状态(即在任何状态更改事件由客户端库发送到监视程序之前)。
在新连接的情况下，发送给观察者的第一个事件通常是会话连接事件

The timing of the PING is conservative enough to ensure reasonable time to detect a dead connection and reconnect to a new server
PING的时间足够保守，可以确保有足够的时间检测死连接并重新连接到新服务器
The application calls an operation on a session that is no longer alive/valid
应用程序调用一个不再有效的会话上的操作

Added in 3.2.0 -- SessionMovedException. There is an internal exception that is generally not seen by clients called the SessionMovedException.
This exception occurs because a request was received on a connection for a session which has been reestablished on a different server. 
The normal cause of this error is a client that sends a request to a server, but the network packet gets delayed, so the client times out and connects to a new server.
When the delayed packet arrives at the first server, the old server detects that the session has moved, and closes the client connection. 
Clients normally do not see this error since they do not read from those old connections. (Old connections are usually closed.) One situation in which this condition can be seen is when two clients try to reestablish the same connection using a saved session id and password. One of the clients will reestablish the connection and the second client will be disconnected (causing the pair to attempt to re-establish its connection/session indefinitely)
有一个内部异常通常不会被客户端看到，它叫做SessionMovedException。发生此异常是因为在连接上接收了已在不同服务器上重新建立的会话的请求。
这个错误的正常原因是客户机向服务器发送了一个请求，但是网络包被延迟了，所以客户机超时并连接到一个新服务器。
当延迟的包到达第一个服务器时，旧服务器检测到会话已经移动，并关闭客户端连接。客户端通常不会看到这个错误，因为他们不会从那些旧的连接中读取数据。
(旧的连接通常是关闭的。)可以看到这种情况的一种情况是，两个客户机试图使用保存的会话id和密码重新建立相同的连接。
其中一个客户端将重新建立连接，而第二个客户端将被断开连接(导致这对客户端试图无限期地重新建立其连接/会话)。

The function invokes a probabilistic load-balancing algorithm which may cause the client to disconnect from its current host with the goal to achieve expected uniform number of connections per server in the new list
该函数调用一个概率负载平衡算法，该算法可能导致客户端从当前主机断开连接，目的是在新列表中实现每个服务器的预期统一连接数
In case the current host to which the client is connected is not in the new list this call will always cause the connection to be dropped. Otherwise,
the decision is based on whether the number of servers has increased or decreased and by how much.
如果客户端所连接的当前主机不在新列表中，则此调用将始终导致连接被删除。否则，决策将基于服务器的数量是增加了还是减少了，以及增加了多少。
For example, if the previous connection string contained 3 hosts and now the list contains these 3 hosts and 2 more hosts, 40% of clients connected to each of the 3 hosts will move to one of the new hosts in order to balance the load.
The algorithm will cause the client to drop its connection to the current host to which it is connected with probability 0.4 and in this case cause the client to connect to one of the 2 new hosts, chosen at random
例如，如果以前的连接字符串包含3台主机，而现在列表包含这3台主机和另外2台主机，那么连接到这3台主机的客户端中有40%将移动到其中一台新主机，以平衡负载。该算法将导致客户端放弃其与当前主机的连接(概率为0.4)，在这种情况下，将导致客户端连接到随机选择的两个新主机中的一个
 each client decides to disconnect with probability 0.4 but once the decision is made, it will try to connect to a random new server and only if it cannot connect to any of the new servers will it try to connect to the old ones
每个客户决定断开与概率0.4，但一旦决定

What's the reason for having the config option to disable local session upgrade?
In a large deployment which wants to handle a very large number of clients, we know that clients connecting via the observers which is supposed to be local session only. 
So this is more like a safeguard against someone accidentally creates lots of ephemeral nodes and global sessions
使用配置选项来禁用本地会话升级的原因是什么?
在一个需要处理大量客户机的大型部署中，我们知道客户机通过观察者连接，而观察者应该只是本地会话。
因此，这更像是一种防范意外创建大量临时节点和全局会话的安全措施


What happens if the create for session is sent at server A and the client disconnects to some other server B which ends up sending it again and then disconnects and connects back to server A?

When a client reconnects to B, its sessionId won’t exist in B’s local session tracker. So B will send validation packet. 
If CreateSession issued by A is committed before validation packet arrive the client will be able to connect. 
Otherwise, the client will get session expired because the quorum hasn’t know about this session yet. 
If the client also tries to connect back to A again, the session is already removed from local session tracker.
So A will need to send a validation packet to the leader. The outcome should be the same as B depending on the timing of the request
我们知道客户端通过观察员连接，这应该是本地会话

如果create for session是在服务器A上发送的，客户端断开与其他服务器B的连接，服务器B再次发送它，然后断开连接，重新连接到服务器A，会发生什么情况?

当客户端重新连接到B时，它的sessionId在B的本地会话跟踪器中不存在。所以B会发送验证包。如果在验证包到达之前提交了由A发出的CreateSession，
客户端将能够连接。否则，客户端将获得会话过期，因为quorum还不知道这个会话。如果客户端还试图再次连接回，则会话已从本地会话跟踪器中删除。
所以A需要发送一个验证包给leader。根据请求的时间，结果应该与B相同。
Sent to the client This implies that an event is on the way to the client, 
but may not reach the client before the successful return code to the change operation reaches the client that initiated the change. 
Watches are sent asynchronously to watchers. ZooKeeper provides an ordering guarantee: a client will never see a change for which it has set a watch until it first sees the watch event.
Network delays or other factors may cause different clients to see watches and return codes from updates at different times.
The key point is that everything seen by the different clients will have a consistent order.
发送到客户端这意味着一个事件正在发送到客户端途中，但是可能在成功返回到更改操作的代码到达发起更改的客户端之前无法到达客户端。
手表以异步方式发送给观察者。ZooKeeper提供了一个顺序保证:在第一次看到watch事件之前，客户端永远不会看到已经为其设置了一个watch的更改。
网络延迟或其他因素可能会导致不同的客户端看到手表，并在不同的时间从更新中返回代码。
关键是不同客户看到的所有东西都有一个一致的顺序。

The data for which the watch was set 。This refers to the different ways a node can change.
It helps to think of ZooKeeper as maintaining two lists of watches: data watches and child watches. 
getData() and exists() set data watches. getChildren() sets child watches. 
Alternatively, it may help to think of watches being set according to the kind of data returned.
getData() and exists() return information about the data of the node, whereas getChildren() returns a list of children.
Thus, setData() will trigger data watches for the znode being set (assuming the set is successful). 
A successful create() will trigger a data watch for the znode being created and a child watch for the parent znode.
A successful delete() will trigger both a data watch and a child watch (since there can be no more children) for a znode being deleted as well as a child watch for the parent znode
设置手表的数据。这指的是一个节点改变的不同方式。可以将ZooKeeper看作是维护两个表:数据表和子表。
getData()和exists()设置数据手表。getChildren()设置子手表。或者，可以考虑根据返回的数据类型设置手表。
getData()和exists()返回关于节点数据的信息，而getChildren()返回子节点的列表。
因此，setData()将触发正在设置的znode的数据监视(假设设置成功)。成功的create()将触发正在创建的znode的数据监视，以及父znode的子监视。
成功的delete()将同时触发删除znode的数据监视和监视(因为不能有更多的监视)，以及父znode的监视
any previously registered watches will be reregistered and triggered if needed. In general this all occurs transparently.
任何以前注册的手表将重新注册，并在需要时触发。一般来说，这一切都是透明的。

New in 3.6.0: Clients can also set permanent, recursive watches on a znode that are not removed when triggered and that trigger for changes on the registered znode as well as any children znodes recursively
3.6.0中的新特性:客户端还可以在znode上设置永久的递归监视，这些监视在被触发时不会被删除，并且会触发已注册的znode以及任何子znode上的递归更改

New in 3.6.0: There is now a variation on the standard watch described above whereby you can set a watch that does not get removed when triggered. Additionally, these watches trigger the event types NodeCreated, NodeDeleted, and NodeDataChanged and, optionally, recursively for all znodes starting at the znode that the watch is registered for. Note that NodeChildrenChanged events are not triggered for persistent recursive watches as it would be redundant.

Persistent watches are set using the method addWatch(). 
The triggering semantics and guarantees (other than one-time triggering) are the same as standard watches. 
The only exception regarding events is that recursive persistent watchers never trigger child changed events as they are redundant.
Persistent watches are removed using removeWatches() with watcher type WatcherType.Any
新的在3.6.0:现在有一个变化的标准手表描述上述，你可以设置一个手表不被删除时触发。此外，这些手表会触发nodecated、NodeDeleted和NodeDataChanged事件类型，
并可选地递归地触发从手表注册的znode开始的所有znode。注意，NodeChildrenChanged事件不会被持久递归监视触发，因为它是冗余的。

持久性监视是使用addWatch()方法设置的。触发语义和保证(除了一次性触发之外)与标准手表相同。关于事件的惟一例外是，
递归持久观察者永远不会触发子更改事件，因为它们是冗余的。使用带有watcher类型WatcherType.Any的removeWatches()来删除持久手表。
Watches are ordered with respect to other events, other watches, and asynchronous replies
根据其他事件、其他手表和异步响应对监听进行排序
A client will see a watch event for a znode it is watching before seeing the new data that corresponds to that znode.

The order of watch events from ZooKeeper corresponds to the order of the updates as seen by the ZooKeeper service.
在看到与该znode相对应的新数据之前，客户机将看到它正在监视的znode的监视事件。

来自ZooKeeper的观看事件的顺序对应于由ZooKeeper服务看到的更新的顺序。
For example, if the same watch object is registered for an exists and a getData call for the same file and that file is then deleted, 
the watch object would only be invoked once with the deletion notification for the file
例如，如果为exists和getData调用注册了相同的监视对象，然后删除了该文件，那么该监视对象只会被该文件的删除通知调用一次
it employs permission bits to allow/disallow various operations against a node and the scope to which the bits apply
它使用权限位来允许/不允许对一个节点进行各种操作，以及这些位所适用的范围

The CREATE and DELETE permissions have been broken out of the WRITE permission for finer grained access controls
创建和删除权限已经从更细粒度的访问控制的写权限中被打破

Also, the ADMIN permission is there since ZooKeeper doesn’t have a notion of file owner. 
In some sense the ADMIN permission designates the entity as the owner. 
ZooKeeper doesn’t support the LOOKUP permission (execute permission bit on directories to allow you to LOOKUP even though you can't list the directory). 
Everyone implicitly has LOOKUP permission. This allows you to stat a node, but nothing more. 
(The problem is, if you want to call zoo_exists() on a node that doesn't exist, there is no permission to check.)
此外，管理员权限是存在的，因为ZooKeeper没有文件所有者的概念。在某种意义上，管理权限指定实体为所有者。
ZooKeeper不支持查找权限(在目录上执行权限位，即使不能列出目录也可以查找)。每个人都隐式地拥有查找权限。
这允许您统计一个节点，但仅此而已。(问题是，如果您想在不存在的节点上调用zoo_exists()，则没有检查权限。)

auth is a special scheme which ignores any provided expression and instead uses the current user, credentials, and scheme. 
Any expression (whether user like with SASL authentication or user:password like with DIGEST authentication) provided is ignored by the ZooKeeper server when persisting the ACL. 
However, the expression must still be provided in the ACL because the ACL must match the form scheme:expression:perms.
This scheme is provided as a convenience as it is a common use-case for a user to create a znode and then restrict access to that znode to only that user. 
If there is no authenticated user, setting an ACL with the auth scheme will fail
auth是一种特殊的模式，它忽略任何提供的表达式，而是使用当前用户、凭据和模式。
当持久化ACL时，ZooKeeper服务器将忽略提供的任何表达式(不管是用户喜欢SASL身份验证还是用户:密码喜欢摘要身份验证)。
但是，表达式仍然必须在ACL中提供，因为ACL必须匹配表单scheme:expression:perms。提供此方案是为了方便，因为用户通常会创建一个znode，然后将对该znode的访问限制为只针对该用户。
如果没有经过身份验证的用户，则使用auth模式设置ACL将失败

This is usually done as soon as the client connects to a server and consists of validating information sent from or gathered about a client and associating it with the connection
这通常是在客户端连接到服务器时完成的，包括验证从客户端发送或收集的关于客户端的信息，并将其与连接关联起来

Its two constructors differ only by an optional session id and password. ZooKeeper supports session recovery across instances of a process
它的两个构造函数只有可选的会话id和密码不同。ZooKeeper支持跨进程实例的会话恢复

All completions for asynchronous calls and watcher callbacks will be made in order, one at a time. 
The caller can do any processing they wish, but no other callbacks will be processed during that time
异步调用和监视程序回调的所有完成将依次进行，一次完成一个。调用者可以做任何他们想做的处理，但是在此期间不会处理任何其他回调


Note that if there is a change to /a between the asynchronous read and the synchronous read, 
the client library will receive the watch event saying /a changed before the response for the synchronous read,
but because of the completion callback blocking the event queue, the synchronous read will return with the new value of /a before the watch event is processed

注意,如果有更改/异步读取和同步阅读,客户端库将收到之前的观察事件说/改变响应的同步阅读,但由于完成回调阻塞事件队列,同步阅读的新值将返回/前观察事件处理

The list of ZooKeeper servers used by the client must match the list of ZooKeeper servers that each ZooKeeper server has. 
Things can work, although not optimally, if the client list is a subset of the real list of ZooKeeper servers, 
but not if the client lists ZooKeeper servers not in the ZooKeeper cluster
客户端使用的ZooKeeper服务器列表必须与每个ZooKeeper服务器拥有的ZooKeeper服务器列表匹配。如果客户端列表是ZooKeeper服务器的实际列表的一个子集，那么一切都可以正常运行，但如果客户端列出了不在ZooKeeper集群中的ZooKeeper服务器，情况就不一样了

Be careful where you put that transaction log. The most performance-critical part of ZooKeeper is the transaction log. 
ZooKeeper must sync transactions to media before it returns a response.
A dedicated transaction log device is key to consistent good performance.
Putting the log on a busy device will adversely effect performance.
If you only have one storage device, put trace files on NFS and increase the snapshotCount; 
it doesn't eliminate the problem, but it can mitigate it
小心你把事务日志放在什么地方。ZooKeeper中对性能最关键的部分是事务日志。在返回响应之前，ZooKeeper必须将事务同步到媒体。
专用事务日志设备是保持良好性能的关键。将日志放在繁忙的设备上会对性能产生负面影响。
如果您只有一个存储设备，那么将跟踪文件放在NFS上，并增加snapshotCount;它不能消除问题，但可以减轻问题

Conventionally, ZooKeeper applications are broken into two units, one which maintains the connection, and the other which monitors data.
通常，ZooKeeper应用程序分为两个单元，一个负责维护连接，另一个负责监控数据
Recall that the Executor's job is to start and stop the executable whose name you pass in on the command line. 
It does this in response to events fired by the ZooKeeper object. As you can see in the code above, the Executor passes a reference to itself as the Watcher argument in the ZooKeeper constructor. It also passes a reference to itself as DataMonitorListener argument to the DataMonitor constructor. 
Per the Executor's definition, it implements both these interfaces
回想一下，执行者的工作是启动和停止在命令行中传递其名称的可执行文件。它这样做是为了响应ZooKeeper对象触发的事件。
正如您在上面的代码中所看到的，执行器在ZooKeeper构造函数中将引用作为观察者参数传递给自身。
它还将引用作为DataMonitorListener参数传递给DataMonitor构造函数。
根据执行者的定义，它实现这两个接口

The Watcher interface is defined by the ZooKeeper Java API. 
ZooKeeper uses it to communicate back to its container. It supports only one method, process(), 
and ZooKeeper uses it to communicates generic events that the main thread would be interested in, 
such as the state of the ZooKeeper connection or the ZooKeeper session. 
The Executor in this example simply forwards those events down to the DataMonitor to decide what to do with them. 
It does this simply to illustrate the point that, by convention, the Executor or some Executor-like object "owns" the ZooKeeper connection, 
but it is free to delegate the events to other events to other objects. It also uses this as the default channel on which to fire watch events. (More on this later.)
观察者接口是由ZooKeeper Java API定义的。ZooKeeper使用它与容器进行通信。它只支持一个方法，process()， 
ZooKeeper使用它来传递主线程感兴趣的一般事件，比如ZooKeeper连接或ZooKeeper会话的状态。
本例中的执行程序只是将这些事件转发给DataMonitor来决定如何处理它们。
这样做只是为了说明，按照惯例，执行程序或某些类似于执行程序的对象“拥有”ZooKeeper连接，
但是可以自由地将事件委托给其他事件，也可以委托给其他对象。它还将此作为触发监视事件的默认通道。(稍后会详细介绍。)

Note, it doesn't have to do any Exception processing for the getData call because it has watches pending for anything that could cause an error: 
if the node is deleted before it calls ZooKeeper.getData(), the watch event set by the ZooKeeper.exists() triggers a callback
注意，它不必对getData调用执行任何异常处理，因为它有可能导致错误的监视:如果节点在调用ZooKeeper.getData()之前被删除，则由ZooKeeper.exists()设置的监视事件将触发回调

Both classes extend SyncPrimitive. In this way, we execute steps that are common to all primitives in the constructor of SyncPrimitive
这两个类都扩展了SyncPrimitive。通过这种方式，我们可以执行SyncPrimitive构造函数中所有原语共有的步骤

We use the process() method to process notifications triggered due to watches. 
In the following discussion, we present code that sets watches. A watch is internal structure that enables ZooKeeper to notify a client of a change to a node. 
For example, if a client is waiting for other clients to leave a barrier, then it can set a watch and wait for modifications to a particular node, which can indicate that it is the the end of the wait
我们使用process()方法来处理由于监视而触发的通知。在接下来的讨论中，我们将介绍设置手表的代码。监视是一种内部结构，它使ZooKeeper能够将节点的更改通知客户端。例如，如果一个客户端正在等待其他客户端离开屏障，
那么它可以设置一个监视并等待对某个特定节点的修改，这可能表明等待已经结束。一旦我们看了这些例子，这一点就清楚了

A barrier is a primitive that enables a group of processes to synchronize the beginning and the end of a computation. 
The general idea of this implementation is to have a barrier node that serves the purpose of being a parent for individual process nodes. 
Suppose that we call the barrier node "/b1". Each process "p" then creates a node "/b1/p". 
Once enough processes have created their corresponding nodes, joined processes can start the computation
barrier是一个原语，它使一组进程能够同步计算的开始和结束。该实现的总体思想是使用barrier节点，它的作用是充当各个流程节点的父节点。
假设我们称势垒节点为“/b1”。每个进程“p”然后创建一个节点“/b1/p”。一旦足够多的进程创建了相应的节点，连接的进程就可以开始计算
