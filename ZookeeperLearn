A name is a sequence of path elements separated by a slash (/). Every node in ZooKeeper's namespace is identified by a path
名称是由斜杠(/)分隔的路径元素序列。ZooKeeper名称空间中的每个节点都由一个路径标识

ZooKeeper also has the notion of ephemeral nodes. These znodes exists as long as the session that created the znode is active. 
When the session ends the znode is deleted
